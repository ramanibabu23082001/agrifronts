    <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
    <p>Agriculture occupies a very important role in the growth of economy of our country, which is also the backbone of the economic 
    	system. India is primarily an "<b>agricultural country</b>". The prosperty of the Indian economy is dependent on the course of 
    agricultural production. Of course, agriculture contributes a major share of the national Income of India. In India, agriculture 
meets almost the entire food requirements of the people. Agriculture also provides fodder to the sustain livestock whose number 
runs to several cores.</p>
    <p>In the feild of agriculture, marketing determines the value of the agricultural product in terms of money and delivers them to
     the final customer. Most of the farmers sell thier produce through village level markets,fairs,mandies,co-operative societies etc. 
 In the above process of agricultural marketing, the middlemen exploit farmers as well as consumers. In order to eliminate the middlemen
  between farmers and consumers, the government of Tamilnadu introduced the new concept, namely "UZHAVAR SANTHAI" in 1990</p>
    <p>Generally, the middlemen and wholesale businessmen purchase the Agriclutural products from the farmers at a lower price. They
     also get the commission from the farmers for the transaction made. In turn fresh vegetables and fruits purchased at the lower
      price from the farmers are sold out to retail businessmen at higher price and the retail businessmen sell those agricultural products further at
       higher price to the consumers. As a result, the farmers get only the lower price for thier produce whereas the consumers have to pay higher price
        for the same produce. Hence, the GOVERMENT OF TAMILNADU introduced an alternate scheme of marketing, which is known as "<b>UZHAVAR SANTHAI</b>"
         in order to derive more benifits to the farmers as well as consumers.</p></br></br>
